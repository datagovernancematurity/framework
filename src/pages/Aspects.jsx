        <h2>Scoring Method</h2>
        <p>
          Each response within the evaluation instrument is mapped to a maturity level based on the selected criteria. The overall maturity of a given dimension is determined by aggregating the scores of its three aspects. The model employs the Minimum Level Rule, which assigns the dimension the lowest score among its aspectsâ€”thus emphasizing bottlenecks or constraints that may hinder maturity.
